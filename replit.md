# EUCevents - Event Management System with Telegram Bot

## Overview

Repository: https://github.com/PavelDemyanov/EUCevents

This is a full-stack web application with an integrated Telegram bot for managing events and participant registration. The system allows administrators to create and manage events through a web interface while participants can register via Telegram bots. The application supports multiple events, participant management, automated PDF report generation, and comprehensive data editing capabilities for registered participants.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Phone number format preference: Accept multiple input formats (8XXXXXXXXXX, +7XXXXXXXXXX, 7XXXXXXXXXX) but store as 7XXXXXXXXXX and display as +7 (XXX) XXX-XX-XX throughout the system.
